Assignment 3 Report

Name:

1. If you included files other than baseline_crf.py, advanced_crf.py, evaluate_model.py,
 and hw3_corpus_tool.py, or modified hw3_corpus_tool.py please describe what the files do and/or your
  modifications to hw3_corpus_tool.py.

  I have used hw_corpus_tool.py and embedded it the baseline_crf.py and advance_crf.py.
  I have used split_files.py to split the data into training and test dataset.
  I have used sklearn.cross_validation.train_test_split for this purpose to split in 75:25 ratio.

2. Describe how you evaluated your baseline and advanced features

   I have used evaluate_model.py to check the number of correctly predicted labels from
   the output file and the ground truth labels. The evaluation is done on the 25% of test dataset.

3. Describe your advanced feature set.

    I have tried bigram and trigram features in the advanced features , along with the baseline features
    i.e. unigram and change of speaker features.


4. If you tried alternate advanced feature sets, please describe them.

   I tried the lowercase for the words, but it dint show any significant improvement.
   Also tried a range of different coefficient for L1 and L2 penalty. I tried to increase the
   number of iterations to for both baseline and advanced but it timed-out when I tried to increase it
   beyond 50 and 75 respectively

5. Accuracy of baseline features was:  71.8103222426%
6. Accuracy of advanced features was:  73.0940529211%
